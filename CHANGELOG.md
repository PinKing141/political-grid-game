## v0.9-freeze - 2026-02-14
Overton v0.9-freeze is now locked as a stability-focused baseline for the current gameplay scope, with no new mechanics introduced in this cut. This freeze pass prioritizes reliability of core flows—turn progression, speed controls, elections, game-over handling, faction actions, and save/load continuity—while applying targeted desync hardening around load-state transitions and UI synchronization. The goal of this tag is to provide a clean, testable checkpoint for polishing, balancing, and regression testing before any future feature expansion.
